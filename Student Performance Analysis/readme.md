# 📚 Student Performance Analysis

Analyze academic performance trends and identify key factors affecting student marks using Python and data visualization.

## 🔍 Overview

This project investigates student performance using a real dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical insights to understand how various features like study hours, test scores, and attendance influence marks.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`student_data.csv`) includes:

- `Student_ID`
- `Name`
- `Test_1`, `Test_2`, `Test_3`
- `Assignment_Score`
- `Attendance (%)`
- `Final_Marks`

> 📦 Source: Manually compiled / synthetic (for practice use)

## 📊 Features Covered

- Null value detection and handling
- Statistical summaries (mean, median, mode)
- Correlation heatmap between variables
- Average score per test
- Attendance vs marks relationship
- Final grade classification (if included)

## 📌 Key Insights

- High correlation found between attendance and final marks.
- Test 2 performance showed strongest link to final grades.
- Students with assignment scores above 85% generally scored higher overall.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Upload `student_data.csv`.
3. Execute the cells step-by-step.
